                <p>The objective today is to explore the potential of solar energy for your home. We'll provide a clear understanding of solar incentive programs, walk you through our thorough evaluation process, and address any concerns you may have and help you determine if its a fit. We achieve this by comparing your current situation with the utility to what your costs would look like if you transitioned  to solar. If, after our discussion, you find no advantages to your current utility situation, we can initiate the process and get your home listed as an active job. If you decide otherwise, that's perfectly alright tooâ€”we're just pleased to have provided you with valuable insights. </p>
